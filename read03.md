###  What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?

Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

### Examples of wireframes:

- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil
- With the help of paper-prototypes
- Switching later to software

## So what is HTML
HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content.
![html](https://xwww.mutah.edu.jo/yumna/what-is-html.jpg)

### The main parts of our element are as follows
- The opening tag
- The closing tag
- The content 
- The element

#### Nesting elements:
You can put elements inside other elements too .
ex. <p>element </p>

#### Empty elements
Some elements have no content and are called empty elements
ex. <img src="">
