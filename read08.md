# Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
java script includes many control structures

## JavaScript Functions:
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
### JavaScript Function Syntax:

function name (){

  code
}

### Function Return:
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
### Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
